## Introduction
If you already have your Docker environment set up, how about deploying your app with single push-the-button? That’s what we want to achieve with Docklio — to make system admin’s life easier. Docklio allows users to control their Docker containers by sending text messages and Docklio will send back a message to confirm the container status.

## How to Use
On Docker machine run: docker run -d -p 80:80 p0bailey/docker-flask

This Flask Sample application is based off the work of:
